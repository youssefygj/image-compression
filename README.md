# image-compression
I completed a project on image compression using run-length encoding (RLE) in Python. RLE is a simple technique that reduces the size of an image by encoding consecutive pixels of the same color as a single value. I used a Python notebook provided by the instructor and implemented my own RLE algorithm. I also tested my code on different images and compared the compression ratio and quality of the output. This project helped me learn about image processing and data compression in Python.
